			<p>Gender inequality is a serious problem that exists in many societies around the world and leads to unequal treatment between men and women.<br> We need to work to achieve equality and respect for every person regardless of their gender.</p>

			<p>As you know, gender inequality affects both sexes. Women often face restrictions on freedom and choice, harassment and physical violence. Men in most cases can suffer from imposed ideas about what a "real man" should be and also find themselves under pressure from society, because they are forced to hide their emotions and "be strong".
I, like most of my peers, am convinced that equal rights between women and men will improve the prospects for the future generation.
It is more comfortable to live in a society where men and women are valued equally.</p>

			<p>Gender inequality is a very serious problem in society. Many male representatives hide behind the fact that they are "men", and believe that they are allowed to do many things. Such as harassment towards the female sex and so on. A woman in society often receives a large share of condemnation/harassment from the opposite sex, we see this in many areas of life and not only in this, but also at home, they face violence, during which a woman is most often accused. But of course the oppression also falls on the male side, such as "this is not a man's business", "a man should be like that..", and pressure from many close people who point to a "real man".
We must create a society where there would be no misogyny, harassment, victimblaming, oppression of human interests and pressure from society.</p>

			<p>Gender inequality is unfair and unacceptable discrimination of people based on their gender. <br>It leads to limitations in the opportunities, rights and freedoms of people, as well as limits their potential and development.</p>

			<p>Gender inequality limits people's opportunities based on their gender and can lead to social and economic exclusion, violence and other forms of resistance.

I believe that all people should have equal opportunities and rights, regardless of their gender, and that eliminating gender inequality is not only a moral, but also a practical step towards a more just and prosperous society.</p>
