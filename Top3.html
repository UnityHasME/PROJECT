    </li>
    <li>
  Women's quotas in Parliament: In 1980, Iceland became the first country in the world where women make up more than 40% of the parliament. This result was achieved thanks to the women's quotas, which were introduced in 1983.
    </li>
    <li>
   Rallies and strikes: Women in Iceland hold many rallies and strikes to draw attention to the issue of gender equality. For example, in 2016, women took to the streets to protest against gender discrimination and violence.

<hr size=1>

        <u><h2><p><li>Canada:</p></h2></u></li>

    </p>
    <UL>
    <li>
    The Law on Multiple Citizenship: In 2017, Canada passed the Multiple Citizenship Act, which allows Canadians to retain their citizenship even if they obtain citizenship of another country. This is especially important for women who are forced to leave Canada to marry a foreigner, but can now retain their status as a Canadian citizen.
    </li>
    <li>
    Gender Identity Law: In 2017, Canada passed the Gender Identity Law, which recognizes the right of transgender people to self-determination and simplifies the procedure for changing their gender in official documents.
    </li>
    <li>
   National Strategy for Gender Equality: In 2018, Canada launched a National Strategy for Gender Equality, which includes financial support for projects aimed at supporting women, initiatives to combat violence against women and transgender people, as well as improving access to finance for women entrepreneurs.
    </li>
    <li>
    Rallies and strikes: Women in Canada hold many rallies and strikes to draw attention to the issue of gender equality. For example, in 2017, a protest march of thousands called "Women March" took place in Canada, which was organized in response to the threat of the abolition of women's abortion rights in the United States.
    </li>
    <li>
   Programs at the federal and municipal levels: Canada also has many programs and initiatives at the federal and municipal levels aimed at achieving gender equality. For example, at the federal level there is a program "Women of Science", which is designed to increase the participation of women in research and scientific work, and at the municipal level there is a program "Achieving gender equality in cities", which is aimed at creating equal opportunities and conditions for women in cities.    </li>  
    <li>
    Educational programs: Canada is also taking measures to combat gender stereotypes in education. In some provinces, programs have been launched that teach students about gender issues and violence against women, as well as aimed at raising awareness about gender identity.
    </li>
    <li>
    Equal pay: Canada is also working to increase the level of pay for women in order to achieve wage equality between men and women. In 2018, Canada launched the Equal Pay Index, which provides companies and organizations with tools to assess the level of pay and take measures to eliminate inequality in this area.
    </li>

    </UL>
    <p>
  These are just a few examples of the measures that these countries are taking to achieve gender equality. In general, they are all considered to be one of the most advanced countries in the world on this issue.

    <p><u>
    By eliminating gender inequality, Sweden, Iceland and Canada have received many benefits, including:
  </p></u>
</OL>
  <UL>
<li>Economic Growth: Gender equality can promote economic growth because women have access to better education and employment opportunities, which can increase productivity and reduce unemployment.
</li>
<li>Poverty reduction: Gender equality can reduce poverty because women receive higher wages and have greater access to resources such as education and health care.
</li>
<li>Improving health care: Women living in countries with gender equality have greater access to health care, which can improve the quality of life and improve the overall health of the nation.
</li>
<li>Increasing the level of happiness: Research shows that gender equality can increase the level of happiness and well-being in society, as people have more opportunities for self-realization and development.
</li>
<li>Social stability: Gender equality can improve social stability, as it reduces inequality and discontent in society, as well as promotes the development of a more democratic and open culture.
</li>
</UL>
<p>
  In general, the elimination of gender inequality can bring numerous benefits for the country, including economic growth, poverty reduction, improved health care, increased happiness and social stability.

  <h2>GII is a composite metric of gender inequality using<br> three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market.<br> A low GII value indicates low inequality between women and men, and vice-versa.</h2>
  <h4><p>GII reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions— reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions. GII values are computed using the association-sensitive inequality measure suggested by Seth (2009), which implies that the index is based on the general mean of general means of different orders—the first aggregation is by a geometric mean across dimensions; these means, calculated separately for women and men, are then aggregated using a harmonic mean across genders.</p></h4>
